# 🎧 RhythMix Audio Player

**RhythMix** is a feature-rich desktop audio player built with **C++** and the **JUCE Framework**, developed as part of the **CS213 (Object-Oriented Programming)** course at **FCAI – Cairo University**, under the supervision of **Dr. Mohamed El Ramly**.

This project combines **audio processing**, **interactive GUI design**, and **object-oriented principles** to deliver a modern and intuitive music player experience.

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

This project demonstrates several **OOP principles** in practice:
- **Encapsulation** – managing state within Player and GUI classes  
- **Inheritance** – extending JUCE components for custom behaviors  
- **Polymorphism** – flexible interaction between GUI and audio logic  
- **Abstraction** – separating audio engine, UI, and main application logic
